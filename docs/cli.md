The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory in the command line interface. It provides a view of files and folders in the current directory. You can also use various options with `ls` to customize its output. For example:
- `ls -l`: Lists files in a detailed format, showing permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
- `ls -a`: Displays all files, including hidden files that start with a dot.

## `cat`
The `cat` command is short for "concatenate." It is used to display the contents of a file in the terminal. It can also be used to combine multiple files into one. For example:
- `cat filename.txt`: Displays the content of `filename.txt`.
- `cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt`: Merges `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into a new file called `combined.txt`.
